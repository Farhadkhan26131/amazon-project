# Amazon Clone - My First Web Project

This is a static clone of the Amazon homepage, built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

As a beginner starting my web development journey, this project was a great exercise to practice structuring a website with HTML and styling it with CSS.

## What I Learned
- HTML5 semantic tags
- CSS Flexbox and basic styling
- Importing icons and images
- Creating a simple, static layout

**Note:** This is a front-end project with no functional backend. Buttons and links are for design purposes only.

You can view the project by downloading the files and opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
